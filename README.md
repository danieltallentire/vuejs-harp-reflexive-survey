# HARP Questionnaire

HARP (heightening awareness of research philosophy) is a questionnaire to help researchers understand their own personal biases towards specific research philosophies.

This project draws a spider diagram showing the overall research philosophy and also for each research philosophy, the amount of support from each element of research theories.
